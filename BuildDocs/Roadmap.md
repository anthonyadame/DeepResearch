---

## Long Term (6-12 Months)

- **Adaptive optimization**: integrate circuit breaker, backpressure, and retry strategies into Lightning Server.
  
- **Hybrid retrieval**: combine vector search with reranking and structured knowledge stores.
  
- **Pluggable LLM backends**: extend beyond Ollama to hosted endpoints with unified config.

---

## Stretch Goals: Vector DBs and Search Strategies

- Support for additional vector databases (currently: Qdrant)
- Evaluate search strategies (Vector, PageIndex, KnowledgeGraph, Hybrid, Adaptive)
- Performance, cost, and risk analysis with ROI and cost-per-accuracy-point comparisons across strategies
- Evaluate leveraging Rust components for performance-critical improvements versus .NET baselines
